# 5. Solid Principles - Home Task ðŸ“š

1. Identify SOLID Principles

   Try to identify **at least 1 (one)** example of each SOLID principle. Document them by filling in the table below. Note that you don't need to give code examples itself, just provide the link to file with line numbers range (or whatever you want to clearly recognize the example you describe, e.g. file hello.ts:15-36, class Foo), you can also write free text.

   | Principle                        | Examples |
   | -------------------------------- | -------- |
   | Single Responsibility Principle  |          |
   | Open / Closed Principle          |          |
   | Liskov Substitution Principle    |          |
   | Interface Seggregation Principle |          |
   | Dependency Inversion Principle   |          |

2. Violations of SOLID and Other Principles

   Try to find **at least 1 (one)** violations of each SOLID principle in the project you have chosen for Problem 1 and document it. Additionally, you can describe other (DRY/KISS/YAGNI/etc.) violations.
